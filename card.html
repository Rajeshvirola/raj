		                      <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.</p>
